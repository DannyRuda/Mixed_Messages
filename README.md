## 1. Description
This Project is part of the Full-Stack-Developer career path from codecademy. The purpose of this project is to plan out the implementation of a programm and to practice Version control with git and github when working on a local respository. 
The programm generates a random sentence about Youtubers and prints it to the console.
This project showed me that its more efficient to plan your code ahead and then implement it.  

## 2. Features
+ Generates fully random message made out of 3 components
+ Produces grammatically correct sentences with chosing the right pronoun according to the Youtubers gender
+ The last component of the sentence has unique elements for each Youtuber that only get combined with the corresponding Youtuber

## 3. How to use
Download the main.js file. Then run it via NodeJS, download NodeJS if necessary.

## 4. Technology
Writen purely in JavaScript.
